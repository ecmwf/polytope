## Overview

Cartopy is a Python package designed to make drawing maps for data
analysis and visualisation easy.

It features:

- object oriented projection definitions
- point, line, polygon and image transformations between projections
- integration to expose advanced mapping in Matplotlib with a simple and
  intuitive interface
- powerful vector data handling by integrating shapefile reading with Shapely
  capabilities

Documentation can be found at <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>.
