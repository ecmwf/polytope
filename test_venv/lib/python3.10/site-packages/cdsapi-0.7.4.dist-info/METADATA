Install
-------

Install via `pip` with::

Configure
---------

Get your user ID (UID) and API key from the CDS portal at the address https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user
and write it into the configuration file, so it looks like::

    $ cat ~/.cdsapirc
    url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api/v2
    key: <UID>:<API key>

Remember to agree to the Terms and Conditions of every dataset that you intend to download.


Test
----

Perform a small test retrieve of ERA5 data::

    $ python
    >>> import cdsapi
    >>> cds = cdsapi.Client()
    >>> cds.retrieve('reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels', {
               "variable": "temperature",
               "pressure_level": "1000",
               "product_type": "reanalysis",
               "date": "2017-12-01/2017-12-31",
               "time": "12:00",
