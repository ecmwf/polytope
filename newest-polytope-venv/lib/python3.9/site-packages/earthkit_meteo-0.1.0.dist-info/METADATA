**DISCLAIMER**
This project is **BETA** and will be **Experimental** for the foreseeable future.
Interfaces and functionality are likely to change, and the project itself may be scrapped.
**DO NOT** use this software in any project/software that is operational.

**earthkit-meteo** is a Python package providing meteorological computations using **numpy** input and output.

```python
from earthkit.meteo import thermo
import numpy as np

t = np.array([264.12, 261.45]) # Kelvins
p = np.array([850, 850]) * 100. # Pascals

theta = thermo.potential_temperature(t, p)
```

## Documentation

The documentation can be found at https://earthkit-meteo.readthedocs.io/.

## Install
