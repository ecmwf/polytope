Polytope is a library for extracting complex data from datacubes. It provides an API for
                        non-orthogonal access to data, where the stencil used to extract data from the datacube can be
                        any arbitrary n-dimensional polygon (called a polytope). This can be used to efficiently
                        extract complex features from a datacube, such as polygon regions or spatio-temporal paths.
