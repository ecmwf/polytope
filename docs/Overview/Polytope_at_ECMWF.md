# Polytope at ECMWF

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) data produced at ECMWF can be viewed as a high dimensional datacube (6D or 7D).

    </p>
    </div>

Traditional extraction methods on such a datacube only extract so called "bounding boxes" of data where ranges along each axis are specified.
