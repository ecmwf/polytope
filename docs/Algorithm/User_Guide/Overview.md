# Overview

Polytope can be used in a wide range of applications. 
Consider for example a user who wants to extract wind speed data over a shipping route in the Indian Ocean to estimate the likelihood of severe storms.  Using Polytope, he is able to easily extract the data shown below. 
    <div style="text-align:center">
    <p style="float: middle; margin: 0 5px 0 0px;">
        <img src="../images_users/shipping_route.png" alt="Shipping Route" width="450"/>
    </p>
    </div>

Polytope and its APIs make such complex data requests easily possible for everyone with just a few lines of code.
