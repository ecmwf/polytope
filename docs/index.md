# Welcome to Polytope's documentation!

Polytope is a feature extraction software developed by ECMWF. 
It uses concepts of computational geometry to extract n-dimensional polygons (also known as **polytopes**) from datacubes. 

In particular, it can be used to request:

- 2D cut-outs, such as country cut-outs, from a datacube
    <div style="text-align:center">
    <p style="float: middle; margin: 0 5px 0 0px;">
        <img src="./images/greece.png" alt="Greece cut-out" width="250"/>
    </p>
    </div>

- timeseries from a datacube

- more complicated spatio-temporal paths, such as flight paths, from a datacube

- and many more high-dimensional shapes in arbitrary dimensions...

Note that Polytope reads only the user-requested data, instead of whole fields. Importantly, this implies a significant decrease of the I/O usage when reading data from a datacube.
