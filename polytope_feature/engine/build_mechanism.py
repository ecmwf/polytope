# TODO: apart from the slicer, we now differentiate between diff build mechanisms
# We first have the option to build the tree more breadth first like in the hullslicer
# And we have the second option to build more depth first like in the qubed slicer
# NOTE: in particular, here we differentiate first between different return types as well


# TODO: NOTE each engine will have only one build mechanism, but we can have different slicers on different axes
